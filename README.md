# SSTI Exploit Script

## Description
This script was made while working on the Red Panda machine on Hack the Box. The exploit script connects to a vulnerable site, converts the command into the proper format, injects command into the site, and finally returns the output of the command.

## Usage
The only modifications needed to make the script functional are changing the url that the script will connect to. There may also be another change needed in the filtering portion depending on the server's response to the injection.

See the demo video for a sample usage
